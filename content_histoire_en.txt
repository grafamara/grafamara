# Our History - Grafamara: A Trajectory of Innovation and Partnerships

## From 2017 to Today: Building the Digital Future

The Grafamara adventure began in 2017 in Germany, driven by a clear vision: to demystify technology and make it accessible, secure, and profitable for everyone. What started as a passionate initiative quickly transformed into a recognized IT consulting firm, thanks to our unwavering commitment to excellence and innovation. From our early days, we focused on cybersecurity, anticipating the challenges of an increasingly connected world.

A major milestone in our history is our deep involvement in the digital development of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Convinced of the immense potential of this country, we have established strategic partnerships that have had a significant impact. An emblematic example is our collaboration with **Bosolo TV**, which we supported from its beginnings, contributing to its rapid growth from 0 to over 500,000 subscribers on YouTube. This success demonstrates our expertise in YouTube channel management, multimedia content creation, and technical setup.

Over the years, we have expanded our scope to include business coaching and personal development via the **Grafamara Coaching** platform, as well as comprehensive multimedia solutions (blogs, podcasts). Our partnerships with key players in the DRC such as **ABSY TV** and **8sam ev** strengthen our presence and our understanding of the field. We are also actively exploring opportunities in digital neobanking in the DRC, a promising sector in a country with a young and dynamic population.

Our history is one of constant growth, marked by shared successes with our clients and partners. We continue to write this chapter, remaining faithful to our mission of connecting Europe and the DRC, and transforming the digital landscape for a safer and more prosperous future.
